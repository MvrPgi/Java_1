# Introduction To Java

# Phases Of Java
 - Java Program -> Compile -> Bytecode -> JVM -> Output

# Java IDE
  - Integrated Development Environment
  - Programming environment that packages the basic tools you need to write, test, and debug code.


# Java Codes
- **class** keyword is used to declare a class in Java.
- **public** keyword is an access modifier that represents visibility. It means it is visible to all.
- **static** is a keyword. If we declare any method as static, it is known as a static method. The core advantage of the static method is that there is no need to create an object to invoke the static method. The main method is executed by the JVM, so it doesn't require creating an object to invoke the main method. So it saves memory.
- **void** is the return type of the method. It means it doesn't return any value.
- **main** represents the starting point of the program.
- **String[] args** is used for command line arguments. We will learn it in the next section.
- **System.out.println()** is used to print statement. Here, System is a class, out is an object of PrintStream class, println() is a method of PrintStream class.
- **JVM** is the heart of Java programming language. When we run the Java program, it converts the bytecode into machine language.
- **JRE** is an acronym for *Java Runtime Environment*. It is used to provide runtime environment. It is the implementation of JVM. It physically exists. It contains a set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime.
