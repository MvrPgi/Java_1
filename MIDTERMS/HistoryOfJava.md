# Java
 - Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed for having lesser implementation dependencies. It is a computing platform for application development. Java is fast, reliable, and secure. From laptops to datacenters, game consoles to scientific supercomputers, cell phones to the Internet, 
 - Platform Independent: Java is platform independent, which means that it can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This makes Java one of the most popular programming languages.

# History of Java
 - Java was developed by Sun Microsystems, which was initiated by James Gosling and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform
 - Green Team: The team that developed Java was called the Green Team.
 - The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee.

# Features of Java

### **Simple**: 
  - Java was designed to be easy to use and is therefore easy to write, compile, debug, and learn than other programming languages.

### **Object-Oriented**: 
  - Java is an object-oriented programming language.

### **Platform-Independent**: 
  - Java is platform-independent because it is different from other languages like C, C++, etc. which are compiled into platform-specific machines while Java is a write once, run anywhere language.
  - JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is used to run Java programs.
  - API (Application Programming Interface) is a collection of classes and interfaces that have pre-defined methods.
  - Write Once Run Anywhere (WORA) 
### **Secured**
  - Java is best known for its security. With Java, we can develop virus-free systems. Java is secured because:
    - No explicit pointer
    - Java Programs run inside a virtual machine sandbox
    - Classloader: It is a part of the Java runtime system. It is used to load classes into memory.
    - Bytecode Verifier
    - Security Manager
